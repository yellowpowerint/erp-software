I'll check the codebase to explain the difference between the Assets module and Fleet Management.

Let me check the frontend structure to see the actual modules:

I can see both [assets/](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Plange/Downloads/Projects/mining-erp/dev/frontend/app/assets:0:0-0:0) and [fleet/](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Plange/Downloads/Projects/mining-erp/dev/frontend/app/fleet:0:0-0:0) directories. Let me check what's in each to understand the distinction:





Let me check the backend to understand the data models better:

Let me search for the Asset and FleetAsset models in the Prisma schema:



## Difference Between Assets Module and Fleet Management

Based on the codebase analysis, here's the key distinction:

---

### **Assets Module** ([/assets](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Plange/Downloads/Projects/mining-erp/dev/frontend/app/assets:0:0-0:0))
**General-purpose asset tracking** for all company equipment and property.

**What it tracks:**
- **All types of assets**: Equipment, machinery, tools, furniture, computers, etc.
- **Categories**: VEHICLE, EQUIPMENT, MACHINERY, TOOLS, FURNITURE, IT_EQUIPMENT, OTHER
- **Focus**: Asset lifecycle, depreciation, basic maintenance scheduling

**Key features:**
- Asset registration (code, name, category, purchase info)
- Current value & depreciation tracking
- Location tracking
- Maintenance scheduling (basic)
- Condition monitoring (EXCELLENT → CRITICAL)
- Status tracking (ACTIVE, MAINTENANCE, INACTIVE, RETIRED, DAMAGED)
- Project assignment

**Use case:** Track **any company asset** regardless of type - from office chairs to mining drills.

### **Fleet Management Module** ([/fleet](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Plange/Downloads/Projects/mining-erp/dev/frontend/app/fleet:0:0-0:0))
**Specialized vehicle & mobile equipment management** with operational tracking.

**What it tracks:**
- **Vehicles & mobile machinery only**: Trucks, excavators, drilling rigs, transport vehicles
- **Types**: VEHICLE, HEAVY_MACHINERY, DRILLING_EQUIPMENT, PROCESSING_EQUIPMENT, SUPPORT_EQUIPMENT, TRANSPORT
- **Focus**: Operations, compliance, fuel, assignments, breakdowns

**Key features:**
- **Vehicle-specific data**: Registration number, engine/chassis numbers, odometer, hours
- **Fuel management**: Fuel type, tank capacity, fuel records, fuel tank transactions
- **Operator assignments**: Who's driving/operating, assignment history
- **Compliance tracking**: 
  - Insurance (provider, policy, expiry)
  - Mining permits
  - Safety inspections
  - Emissions certificates
- **Operational tracking**:
  - Usage logs (hours, distance)
  - Breakdown logs
  - Maintenance schedules & records
  - Fleet inspections
- **Cost analytics**: Fuel costs, maintenance costs, total cost MTD/YTD
- **Alerts**: Expiring documents, overdue maintenance, low fuel

**Use case:** Manage **vehicles and mobile equipment** that require fuel, operators, permits, and operational tracking.

### **Simple Rule:**

| Question | Module |
|----------|--------|
| Does it move and need fuel/operators? | **Fleet Management** |
| Is it stationary or general equipment? | **Assets** |
| Does it need permits/insurance? | **Fleet Management** |
| Just tracking value & basic maintenance? | **Assets** |

---

### **Example:**

- **Mining truck** → **Fleet Management** (needs fuel, operator, permits, odometer tracking)
- **Conveyor belt system** → **Assets** (stationary equipment, just needs maintenance)
- **Excavator** → **Fleet Management** (mobile, needs operator, fuel, hours tracking)
- **Office computers** → **Assets** (general equipment, depreciation tracking)
- **Drill rig** → **Fleet Management** (mobile, needs operator, compliance tracking)
- **Generator** → **Assets** (stationary, basic maintenance)

---

### **In Summary:**

**Assets** = General asset registry for everything  
**Fleet** = Specialized module for vehicles/mobile equipment with operational & compliance needs

Fleet Management is essentially a **superset** of asset tracking, adding vehicle-specific operations, fuel, compliance, and assignment features that don't apply to general assets.
