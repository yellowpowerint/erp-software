Great! Now let's complete the integration by updating the website code to fetch jobs from the ERP API and add the application form. Then we'll redeploy.

Let me update the website pages to fetch jobs from the ERP API and integrate the application form:

### Step 1: Update main careers page to fetch from ERP

Now let me update the job listing page and add the application form to job detail pages:

Now let me check and update the jobs listing page:







Now let me check and update the job detail page to add the ApplicationForm:

Now let me update the job detail page to handle the ERP job data structure properly:

Now let me update the rest of the job detail page to use the parsed data:

Let me commit the changes we have so far and push to GitHub:





Perfect! Changes pushed to GitHub. Now let's redeploy the website to production:
